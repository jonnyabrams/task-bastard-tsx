## To-Do List (React & TypeScript)

A to-do list built while trying out React with TypeScript

Add --template typescript to end of usual npx create-react-app command

react-beautiful-dnd for dragging and dropping functionality

Difficulties encountered: had to delete strictmode and add a line to tsconfig at various steps, both fixed by googling the error message that came up
